<!--
  Project Root Index - Redirect to PWA Entry Point
  
  Purpose: Auto-redirect requests to the project root (/) to the frontend
  application's entry point, which is the PWA start_url defined in the
  manifest.webmanifest. This ensures seamless navigation when running the
  development server from the project root.
  
  Flow: http://127.0.0.1:8080/ → http://127.0.0.1:8080/frontend/index.html?utm_source=pwa
  
  Note: This file is NOT served in production. In production, a reverse
  proxy (nginx) or static hosting platform handles routing to frontend/.
  However, this file is necessary in Containter. Do not include this in .gitignore
